# üîì GitHub NuPkg Source Authorisation Action

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a75ea2af278f4d88bc71cc8ca2cae6e6)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/StirlingLabs/GithubNugetAuthAction/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=StirlingLabs/GithubNugetAuthAction&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

> Authorises access to a private GitHub NuGet package source, so you can restore packages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

- This Action writes the PAT value to disk in plain text... because NuGet requires that on linux.
- Please ensure that you scope the PAT to only read packages *and that you are prepared to accept the risk of the PAT escaping*.
