# üîì GitHub NuPkg Source Authorisation Action

> Authorises access to a private GitHub NuGet package source, so you can restore packages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

- This Action writes the PAT value to disk in plain text... because NuGet requires that on linux.
- Please ensure that you scope the PAT to only read packages *and that you are prepared to accept the risk of the PAT escaping*.
